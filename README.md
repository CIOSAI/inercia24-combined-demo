# Entry to In√©rcia party of Portugal, 2024

[on demozoo](https://demozoo.org/productions/362593/)

## Compiling

`cargo build --release`

the release will be under `./target/release`, it runs on the `./` being here, clicking on it will fail, so i run it by doing `./target/release/inercia24.exe`

## Dist (only windows)

run `python ./dist.py` (i'm on 3.9.7)

if that fails try add an empty folder `./dist/`

this packs all of that into a folder under `./dist/` and zip it
